/*
Flatten a nested array. You must account for varying levels of nesting.
*/

// Solution 1: Use recursion, until none of the elements in arr are arrays. Keep calling the function.
when it its in the deeper level start flatening it

function steamrollArray(arr) {
  const flat = [].concat(...arr);
  return flat.some(Array.isArray) ? steamrollArray(flat) : flat;
}

steamrollArray([1, [2], [3, [[4]]]]);

// Solution 2 Or just use the proper method provided by ES5. Sometimes, dont over do it. If there is a method, apply it and solve the problem

function steamrollArray(arr) {

  return  arr.flat(Infinity);

}
